"""
Build empirical GPG and large-industrial demand traces from the AEMO Gas
Bulletin Board (GBB) Actual Flow & Storage data.

These are large, transmission-connected gas users that are reported on the
Bulletin Board as their own facilities (FacilityType BBGPG / BBLARGE) and are
therefore NOT captured in the city distribution demand that demand_2050.csv was
calibrated from. They are added to the model as additional, *curtailable*
demand (see model.py): each tier is served unless the nodal gas price exceeds a
strike price, above which the load sheds instead of paying.

Outputs (written to src/data/):
  - gpg_facilities.csv            per-facility GPG metadata + mean demand + node
  - industrial_facilities_bbg.csv per-facility industrial metadata + node
  - gpg_demand_profile.csv        365-day per-node GPG demand trace (TJ/day)
  - industrial_demand_profile.csv 365-day per-node industrial demand (TJ/day)
  - curtailment_params.csv        strike prices ($/GJ) per demand tier

Method mirrors how demand_profiles.csv was built: average recent years
(2022-2026) of GBB actual flow into a representative day-of-year shape.
